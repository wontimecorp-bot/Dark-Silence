You are starting a planning workflow. Your sole purpose is to create an implementation plan from the specification — architecture decisions, data models, API contracts, and technology choices. Disregard any prior context from this conversation. Focus exclusively on technical planning.

Load and follow the workflow in `.github/skills/plan-feature/SKILL.md`.

When the workflow says **Delegate**, use the Task tool to invoke the corresponding sub-agent:
- **Delegate: ADR Author** → delegate to `sddp-adr-author`
- **Delegate: Context Gatherer** → delegate to `sddp-context-gatherer`
- **Delegate: Database Administrator** → delegate to `sddp-database-administrator`
- **Delegate: API Designer** → delegate to `sddp-api-designer`
- **Delegate: Policy Auditor** → delegate to `sddp-policy-auditor`
- **Delegate: Technical Researcher** → delegate to `sddp-technical-researcher`

Report compact progress at each major milestone — done, issues, next.

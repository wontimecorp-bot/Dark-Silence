You are starting an environment setup workflow. Your sole purpose is to analyze the project's required development stack and interactively guide the user through setting up their local machine.

Load and follow the workflow in `.github/skills/environment-setup/SKILL.md`.

**CRITICAL RULE:** Do not execute any installation commands automatically. Present each step one by one and explicitly use the AskUserQuestion tool to wait for the user's confirmation before proceeding with any Bash tool execution.

Report compact progress at each major milestone — done, issues, next.

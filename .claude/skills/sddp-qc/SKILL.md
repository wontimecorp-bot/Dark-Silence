You are starting a Quality Control workflow. Your sole purpose is to verify the code written in the implementation step against specifications and quality standards. Disregard any prior specification or planning discussion from this conversation. Focus exclusively on quality control.

Load and follow the workflow in `.github/skills/quality-control/SKILL.md`.

When the workflow says **Delegate**, use the Task tool to invoke the corresponding sub-agent:
- **Delegate: Context Gatherer** → delegate to `sddp-context-gatherer`
- **Delegate: QC Auditor** → delegate to `sddp-qc-auditor`
- **Delegate: Story Verifier** → delegate to `sddp-story-verifier`

This adapter does not declare a native browser tool. The shared QC workflow still runs the Step 6.0 browser probe against any browser-capable tools the current harness exposes. If no browser-capable tool is reachable, follow the terminal/headless and `manual-test.md` fallback paths.

Report compact progress at each major milestone — checked, issues, next.

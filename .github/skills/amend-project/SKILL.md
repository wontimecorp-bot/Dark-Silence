# Project Amender Workflow

<rules>
- Project-bootstrap scope only. Do not run feature-delivery phases.
- Never update `specs/prd.md`, `specs/sad.md`, `specs/dod.md`, `specs/project-plan.md`, or `project-instructions.md` directly when an owning bootstrap workflow exists for that artifact. Execute the owning workflow inline instead.
- Read local context first: `README.md`, `project-instructions.md`, `.github/sddp-config.md` when present, and all resolved canonical bootstrap artifacts.
- Resolve canonical document paths using the same config-first, fallback-second pattern used by `project-planning/SKILL.md`.
- `project-instructions.md` is always rooted at the workspace root and is never registered through `.github/sddp-config.md`.
- Product Document, Technical Context Document, and Project Plan are mandatory. Halt if any are unresolvable.
- Deployment & Operations Document is optional. When absent, skip DOD impact analysis and execution.
- `specs/project-plan.md` is always considered for update because any accepted bootstrap change must be reflected in future epic planning.
- Completed epics (`[X]`) in `specs/project-plan.md` are immutable. Only unchecked epics may be adjusted.
- Each inline workflow invocation must receive the full change description plus artifact-specific amendment guidance derived from the impact analysis. Never pass vague instructions like "update as needed".
- Interactive mode: ask the user to confirm or override the impact assessment before executing inline workflows.
- `AUTOPILOT = true`: accept the workflow's recommended/default decisions, do not ask the user, and log automatic decisions when an autopilot log is available in the active context.
- If one inline workflow halts or fails, record the failure, continue with the remaining independent workflows, and report all failures in the summary.
- Idempotency matters: artifacts assessed as `NONE` must not be touched.
</rules>

<workflow>

## 1. Gate Check — Resolve Canonical Documents

Read `.github/sddp-config.md` when it exists.

Resolve each canonical document in this order:

### 1.1 Project Instructions
- Use `project-instructions.md` at the workspace root.
- Missing → **HALT**: "Run `/sddp-init` first to create `project-instructions.md`."

### 1.2 Product Document
- Config: `## Product Document` → `**Path**:` → set `PRODUCT_DOC`
- Fallback: `specs/prd.md`
- Unresolved → **HALT**: "Run `/sddp-prd` first or register the Product Document in `.github/sddp-config.md`."

### 1.3 Technical Context Document
- Config: `## Technical Context Document` → `**Path**:` → set `TECH_CONTEXT_DOC`
- Fallback: `specs/sad.md`
- Unresolved → **HALT**: "Run `/sddp-systemdesign` first or register the Technical Context Document in `.github/sddp-config.md`."

### 1.4 Deployment & Operations Document
- Config: `## Deployment & Operations Document` → `**Path**:` → set `DEPLOY_OPS_DOC`
- Fallback: `specs/dod.md`
- Unresolved → set `HAS_DOD = false` and continue.
- Resolved → set `HAS_DOD = true`.

### 1.5 Project Plan
- Config: `## Project Plan` → `**Path**:` → set `PROJECT_PLAN_DOC`
- Fallback: `specs/project-plan.md`
- Unresolved → **HALT**: "Run `/sddp-projectplan` first or register the Project Plan in `.github/sddp-config.md`."

Read all resolved documents before continuing.

## 2. Analyze Change Impact

Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the change description. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user for the bootstrap change to propagate and halt until a change description is provided.

Summarize the requested change into `CHANGE_SUMMARY` and assess each artifact:

### 2.1 `project-instructions.md`
Set `INSTRUCTIONS_IMPACT = UPDATE` when the change:
- introduces or changes language/runtime, frameworks, storage, or infrastructure choices
- changes testing or quality policy
- changes source layout rules
- conflicts with an existing core principle

Otherwise set `INSTRUCTIONS_IMPACT = NONE`.

### 2.2 Product Document (`PRODUCT_DOC`)
Set `PRD_IMPACT = UPDATE` when the change:
- introduces a new capability or materially changes an existing capability
- adds or removes a target user, buyer, persona, or operating actor
- changes scope boundaries, success measures, or strategic priorities

Otherwise set `PRD_IMPACT = NONE`.

### 2.3 Technical Context Document (`TECH_CONTEXT_DOC`)
Set `SAD_IMPACT = UPDATE` when the change:
- requires a new ADR or revises/supersedes an existing ADR under `specs/adrs/`
- changes architecture boundaries, integrations, trust boundaries, or deployment model assumptions
- changes the data model, interface contracts, or key quality attributes such as performance, scalability, security, or reliability

Otherwise set `SAD_IMPACT = NONE`.

### 2.4 Deployment & Operations Document (`DEPLOY_OPS_DOC`)
If `HAS_DOD = false`, set `DOD_IMPACT = SKIPPED`.

If `HAS_DOD = true`, set `DOD_IMPACT = UPDATE` when the change:
- requires new infrastructure or hosting changes
- changes CI/CD expectations or environment strategy
- adds monitoring, alerting, resilience, or operational readiness requirements
- changes deployment topology, release strategy, incident expectations, or cost controls

Otherwise set `DOD_IMPACT = NONE`.

### 2.5 Project Plan (`PROJECT_PLAN_DOC`)
Set `PROJECT_PLAN_IMPACT = UPDATE`.

Capture a one-line reason for each assessment.

## 3. Present Impact Assessment

Present a concise assessment in this shape:

```text
Change: "<CHANGE_SUMMARY>"

Impact assessment:
- project-instructions.md: UPDATE | NONE — <reason>
- prd.md: UPDATE | NONE — <reason>
- sad.md: UPDATE | NONE — <reason>
- dod.md: UPDATE | NONE | SKIPPED — <reason>
- project-plan.md: UPDATE — <reason>
```

Interactive mode:
- Ask the user to confirm the assessment or override specific artifacts before proceeding.
- Apply explicit user overrides before execution.

`AUTOPILOT = true`:
- Do not ask for confirmation.
- Keep the assessment as the execution plan.
- If an active autopilot log is available, append the accepted assessment and any automatic decisions.

## 4. Build Inline Workflow Inputs

For each artifact with `IMPACT = UPDATE`, build a concrete instruction payload that includes:
- the full `CHANGE_SUMMARY`
- why that artifact must change
- the specific sections, capabilities, ADRs, DDRs, policies, or epics that likely need revision
- any user overrides accepted in Step 3

Minimum payload shapes:

### 4.1 Project Instructions Payload
"Amend project instructions to accommodate: `<CHANGE_SUMMARY>`. Specifically revise core principles, technology stack, testing policy, source layout, and workflow constraints only where this change requires it. Preserve all registered canonical document paths."

### 4.2 Product Document Payload
"Refine the Product Document to incorporate: `<CHANGE_SUMMARY>`. Specifically adjust affected capabilities, scope boundaries, personas, priorities, and success measures. Preserve valid existing narrative and capability IDs."

### 4.3 Technical Context Payload
"Refine the Technical Context Document to accommodate: `<CHANGE_SUMMARY>`. Specifically add or revise the ADRs, architectural boundaries, integrations, data model assumptions, and quality attributes impacted by this change. Preserve valid existing architecture context. For any new, revised, or superseded project-level ADR, delegate to the ADR Author subagent (`.github/agents/_adr-author.md`) — do not write standalone ADR files directly. Update the `specs/sad.md` ADR catalog table with the returned rows."

### 4.4 Deployment & Operations Payload
"Refine the Deployment & Operations Document to accommodate: `<CHANGE_SUMMARY>`. Specifically update environment strategy, CI/CD expectations, infrastructure, observability, reliability, and operational readiness where the change affects them. Preserve valid existing operations context."

### 4.5 Project Plan Payload
"Refine the Project Plan to incorporate: `<CHANGE_SUMMARY>`. Add new epics or update existing unchecked epics as needed. Preserve checked epics. Trace all resulting epic changes back to the updated Product, Technical Context, and Deployment & Operations artifacts."

## 5. Execute Inline Bootstrap Workflows

Execute only the workflows whose artifacts are marked `UPDATE`, in this strict order:

1. `project-instructions.md` → load and execute `.github/skills/init-project/SKILL.md`
2. `PRODUCT_DOC` → load and execute `.github/skills/product-document/SKILL.md`
3. `TECH_CONTEXT_DOC` → load and execute `.github/skills/system-design/SKILL.md`
4. `DEPLOY_OPS_DOC` → load and execute `.github/skills/deployment-operations/SKILL.md` when `HAS_DOD = true` and `DOD_IMPACT = UPDATE`
5. `PROJECT_PLAN_DOC` → load and execute `.github/skills/project-planning/SKILL.md`

Execution rules:
- Pass the artifact-specific payload built in Step 4 as the inline workflow input.
- In interactive mode, preserve the shared workflow's own question/answer behavior.
- In `AUTOPILOT = true`, accept recommended/default answers inside nested workflows and log decisions when possible.
- After each workflow finishes, record one of: `UPDATED`, `SKIPPED`, `FAILED`.
- `FAILED` means the workflow halted or could not complete. Continue to the next independent workflow.

## 6. Summary Report

Return a concise summary with:
- each artifact and whether it was `UPDATED`, `SKIPPED`, or `FAILED`
- one line describing what changed for each updated artifact
- new or modified epic IDs reported by the planning workflow when available
- all failures, if any
- the recommended next step, usually running `/sddp-autopilot` or `/sddp-specify` for the first new or updated epic

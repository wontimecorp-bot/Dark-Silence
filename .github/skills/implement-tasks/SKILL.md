# Software Engineer — Implement Tasks Workflow

<rules>
- Report compact progress at major milestones: outcome, key delta, next step
- **tasks.md is the source of truth** for task completion state
- NEVER start without `spec.md`, `plan.md`, AND `tasks.md`
- Auto-resolve missing gate artifacts before halting (see `references/gates.md`)
- Checklist gate failures → auto-evaluate (prompt user only on second failure)
- **Artifact conventions** (`.github/skills/artifact-conventions/SKILL.md`): Only valid transition: `- [ ]` → `- [X]`. Never reverse, delete checkbox lines, change task IDs (T###), requirement IDs (`FR-###`, `TR-###`, `OR-###`, `RR-###`), success criteria IDs (SC-###), or remove Dependencies/phase headers from tasks.md.
- **Execute ALL phases in ONE CONTINUOUS TURN** — shared phases → delivery work items → Polish
- **NEVER yield control between phases**
- **Prompt user only when**: (1) Gate resolution failure, (2) Checklist override (second failure), (3) Sequential task failure needing manual fix, (4) Final summary with skipped/failed/review issues
- Resume from checkpoint: skip `[X]` tasks, process only `[ ]` tasks
- Mark task complete: `- [ ]` → `- [X]` only after code changes made and validation succeeded. Never infer/simulate completion.
- Never create `.completed` for estimated/simulated/hypothetical success
- If work cannot complete for real → report blocked/failed
- Auto-recover errors before requesting user help
- Only halt for: (1) Gate auto-resolution failed, (2) Sequential task failed after retry + (`AUTOPILOT = true` or user chooses Halt), (3) All tasks already complete
- Research before implementing — **Delegate: Technical Researcher**; reuse `FEATURE_DIR/research.md` when sufficient
- **NEVER provide time/effort estimates** — report only task counts and statuses
- **Mandatory phase review** — structural verification of completed tasks (compilation, file existence, no stubs). Requirement-level verification deferred to `/sddp-qc`.
- **Context budget**: After each phase completes, release full file contents read for that phase's tasks. Keep only key findings summary. Re-read only plan.md/spec.md sections relevant to next phase's work items. Mandatory per-phase checkpoint. **Exception**: retain a compact interface summary (symbol → file → signature) for all `→ exports:` annotated tasks from completed phases. This summary travels forward and is provided to the Developer agent as `PriorExports` context for subsequent phases.
- **State persistence**: After each phase, write/update `FEATURE_DIR/.implement-state` (see Step 5). On resume, read state file first to skip to correct phase.
</rules>

<workflow>

## 0. Acquire Skills

Read `.github/skills/compact-communication/SKILL.md` for terse runtime communication rules, exact-preservation boundaries, and auto-clarity exceptions.

## 1. Gate Check & Resume Detection

Resolve `FEATURE_DIR` from git branch (`specs/<branch>/`) or user context.

**Delegate: Context Gatherer** in **quick mode** (`.github/agents/_context-gatherer.md`). Check `HAS_SPEC`, `HAS_PLAN`, `HAS_TASKS`.

**Run mode:**
- **Resume**: All three `true` AND ≥1 task marked `[X]` → report "Resuming — skipping gate checks" → Step 2
- **Fresh**: Otherwise → execute `references/gates.md` → Step 2

## 2. Load Implementation Context

Read from `FEATURE_DIR`:
- **Load now**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md (if exists)
- **Lazy-load**: data-model.md, contracts/ — defer until task references them

**Delegate: Task Tracker** (`.github/agents/_task-tracker.md`) with `FEATURE_DIR` → store result as `TASK_LIST`.

**Parse state:**
1. Filter `TASK_LIST`: `completed_tasks` (`[X]`), `deferred_tasks` (`[ ]` + `deferred=true`), `incomplete_tasks` (`[ ]` + not deferred)
2. `REMAINING_TASKS` = `incomplete_tasks`
3. Calculate `total_tasks`, `completed_count`, `deferred_count`, `remaining_count`
4. Report: "Loaded [total_tasks] tasks: [completed_count] complete, [remaining_count] active remaining, [deferred_count] deferred"
5. If `remaining_count == 0` and `deferred_count == 0` → "✓ All tasks already complete" → skip to Step 6
6. If `remaining_count == 0` and `deferred_count > 0` → "✓ All non-deferred tasks already complete ([deferred_count] deferred)" → skip to Step 6
7. If partially complete → "Resuming from checkpoint — [completed_count] done, processing [remaining_count] active remaining"
8. **Resume dependency check**: For each task in `REMAINING_TASKS` with `dependencies` (`after:T###`) annotations, verify all referenced tasks are `[X]`. If a referenced task is `[ ]`, re-queue the dependency ahead of the dependent task and report the re-ordered tasks.

Extract tech stack, architecture, file structure from `plan.md`.

## 2.5. Dependency Verification

Scan `plan.md` for declared dependencies. Per package manager detected:
- `package.json` → verify `node_modules/` populated → `npm install` if missing
- `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` → `pip install -r requirements.txt` if deps missing
- `Cargo.toml` → `cargo fetch` if needed
- `go.mod` → `go mod download` if needed
- `.csproj` / `.sln` → `dotnet restore` if needed

Skip if plan.md declares no dependencies or project has no package manifest.

## 3. Research Tech Stack

- If `FEATURE_DIR/research.md` exists → read and extract guidance; skip fresh research when coverage is sufficient; refresh only for unfamiliar/critical/uncovered libraries
- Report: "🔍 Researching library documentation for upcoming tasks..."

**Delegate: Technical Researcher** (`.github/agents/_technical-researcher.md`):
- **Topics**: Official docs/API refs for unfamiliar, critical, or uncovered technologies needed by active tasks
- **Context**: Tech stack and architecture from `plan.md`
- **Purpose**: "Write idiomatic, best-practice code following library conventions"
- **File Paths**: `FEATURE_DIR/plan.md`, `FEATURE_DIR/research.md` (if available)

No high-risk gaps detected → skip delegation.

## 4. Project Setup

> Executed via `references/gates.md` on fresh runs (Step 1). Skipped on resume.

## 5. Execute Tasks

**SINGLE CONTINUOUS LOOP — ALL phases without stopping.**

Process `REMAINING_TASKS` phase-by-phase:
1. **Setup** (title contains "Setup")
2. **Foundational** (title contains "Foundational")
3. **Delivery work items** in priority order (US1/US2... or OBJ1/OBJ2...)
4. **Polish** (title contains "Polish")

> Identify phases by keyword, not fixed number.

**Halt only for:** gate failure, sequential task failed after retry + user chooses Halt, critical system error.

**Per phase:**
1. **Sync state** — re-invoke **Task Tracker** to refresh counts from disk (once per phase)
2. Report: "Starting Phase [N]: [Phase Name] ([task_count] active tasks)"
3. Process each incomplete task
4. Run **Phase Review** on completed tasks
5. Continue to next phase (never stop/ask)

**Per incomplete task:**
- Skip if `[X]`
- Skip if `deferred=true`
- If task has `after:T###` dependencies: verify all referenced tasks are `[X]`. If not, skip and re-queue after the dependency completes.
- Use structured data: `id`, `description`, `parallel`, `story`, `objective`, `workItem`, `phase`, `filePath`, `dependencies`, `imports`, `exports`, `completesRequirement`
- Use `filePath` from Task Tracker when available; otherwise extract file path from description
- Report: "Implementing T### [Phase Name]: [brief description]"

**Delegate: Developer** (`.github/agents/_developer.md`):
   - `TaskID`, `Description`, `Context` (from Plan/Research), `FilePath`, `PlanPath`: `FEATURE_DIR/plan.md`, `DataModelPath`: `FEATURE_DIR/data-model.md` (if exists), `ContractsPath`: `FEATURE_DIR/contracts/` (if exists)
   - `Imports`: parsed `imports` array from Task Tracker (if present) — Developer should read source files to verify actual interfaces
   - `Exports`: parsed `exports` array from Task Tracker (if present) — Developer should ensure these symbols are exported with compatible signatures
   - `PriorExports`: compact interface summary from completed phases (if any) — maps symbol → file → signature for cross-phase dependencies
   - Loop context (when provided by autopilot or the implement-QC loop): `LoopIteration`, `PriorAttempts`, `BugContext`

**On SUCCESS:**
1. If task has `[COMPLETES (FR|TR|OR|RR)-###]`: verify all other tasks tagged with that requirement are `[X]`. If any are not, report: "⚠ [REQ-ID] incomplete — dependent requirement tasks still pending." Skip completion handling for this task and continue.
2. Mark `- [ ]` → `- [X]` in tasks.md
3. Update counts: `completed_count += 1`, `remaining_count -= 1`
4. Report: "✓ T### complete ([completed_count]/[total_tasks])"

**On FAILURE — Error Recovery:**
1. Report: "⚠ T### failed. Analyzing error..."
2. Parse error details (type, message, file, line, suggested fix)
3. Auto-fix by error type:
   - Missing dependencies → run package manager install
   - Import errors → add correct imports
   - Type errors → fix annotations
   - Test failures → analyze output, fix implementation
   - Lint errors → run linter `--fix`
   - Unknown → skip auto-fix
4. If auto-fix attempted → "Retrying T### after auto-fix..." → re-delegate to Developer
5. **Second failure:**
   - **Sequential tasks:**
     1. Report: "✗ T### blocked. Manual intervention required."
     2. **Autopilot guard (I1)**: `AUTOPILOT = true` → default "Halt implementation". Log a `halt` row to `FEATURE_DIR/autopilot-log.md`: Timestamp=now, Phase=`Implement+QC`, Event=`halt`, Detail="T### blocked after retry", Outcome="Halt implementation", Rationale="sequential task unrecoverable failure", Artifacts=`[tasks.md](tasks.md)`.
     3. `AUTOPILOT = false` → prompt: "Skip task and continue" / "Debug manually and retry" / "Halt implementation"
   - **Parallel tasks `[P]`:** mark skipped (not `[X]`), log failure, continue
6. Track all failures for final summary

**Phase Review (after all phase tasks processed):**

Structural verification only — requirement-level verification deferred to `/sddp-qc` Story Verifier.

1. Verify: files created/modified exist and are non-empty
2. Verify: no TODO/FIXME stubs in implemented code (grep)
3. Verify: compilation/type-check passes
4. Verify: exports and public API surface match `plan.md` structure
5. Behavioral spot-check (when tests are absent and `→ exports:` annotations exist in this phase): for each annotated task, verify the exported symbols are importable and have correct arity/type from a scratch validation (e.g., `import { UserModel } from './models/user'` compiles and resolves to a real class/function). Skip this check when no `→ exports:` annotations are present in the phase.
6. Verify all `[COMPLETES (FR|TR|OR|RR)-###]` tasks in this phase have their full requirement chain satisfied (all tasks tagged with the same requirement are `[X]`).
7. Report: "✓ Phase [N] structural review — [pass_count]/[total_in_phase] passed"
8. Failures → report file + issue, continue (never halt)

**State checkpoint**: Write/update `FEATURE_DIR/.implement-state`:
```
phase: [current phase name]
completed: [completed_count]
remaining: [remaining_count]
blocked: [task IDs or "none"]
timestamp: [ISO 8601]
```

Report: "✓ Phase [N] complete — [completed_in_phase] tasks done, [completed_count]/[total_tasks] overall ([remaining_count] remaining)"

**Parallel batch execution** (`[P]` tasks):
1. Group consecutive `[P]` tasks in same phase into a batch
2. Execute all file edits in the batch without intermediate validation
3. Interface consistency check (only when batch contains tasks with `← T###:Symbol` or `→ exports:` annotations): for each annotated `[P]` task, verify referenced symbols exist in the producer's file with a compatible signature. If mismatch → split the batch at the dependency boundary and execute the mismatched tasks sequentially. Skip this check entirely when no annotations are present in the batch.
4. Run validation once per batch (compile + lint + test)
5. Mark all passing tasks `[X]`; retry failing tasks individually

**Execution rules:**
- Sequential tasks: complete in order, retry once
- Parallel `[P]`: batch execution as above, individual failures non-blocking
- When batch validation fails at a consumer file, trace the imported symbol to its producer task. If the producer is in the same batch, retry the producer first, then the consumer — do not retry consumer in isolation.
- Never stop between phases
- Progress counts reflect remaining tasks

## 6. Validate Implementation

Final validation after all phases complete (or halt):

1. Verify implementation matches spec requirements
2. Run tests (if defined in plan.md)
3. Report final summary:
   - Total: [total] / Completed: [completed] ✓ / Skipped: [skipped] (task IDs) / Failed: [failed] (task IDs + errors)
4. If skipped/failed → guidance on next steps; `AUTOPILOT = true` → report blocked, do NOT suggest QC
5. **Completion marker**: If ALL non-deferred tasks completed (0 skipped, 0 failed, `[DEFERRED]` excluded):
   - If `.completed` exists → warn "⚠ `.completed` already exists. Overwriting."
   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/.completed`: `Completed: <ISO 8601 timestamp>` — only after all tasks and reviews actually passed

**Yield control to user** — only natural end point.

- `.completed` created → inform user, suggest `/sddp-qc` with feature name, directory path, and areas needing attention
- `.completed` not created → report blockers; `AUTOPILOT = true` → treat as HALT

## Task
Identify high-impact ambiguity and produce prioritized clarification questions.
## Inputs
Specification file path and ambiguity-audit heuristics.
## Execution Rules
Score uncertainty by impact and return machine-readable outputs only.
## Output Format
Return a single JSON block with coverage status and question queue.

<input>
You will receive:
- `SpecPath`: The path to the feature specification file (e.g., `specs/branch/spec.md`)
</input>

<workflow>

1. Read `.github/skills/clarification-strategies/SKILL.md` for Ambiguity Audit Patterns.
2. Read spec at `SpecPath`. Detect `spec_type` from frontmatter (default: `product`).
3. Scan for ambiguities across:
   - **Functional Scope**: Product→undefined flows, vague terms; Technical→undefined capabilities, migration, compatibility; Operational→undefined deploy/recovery behavior.
   - **Domain & Data Model**: Product/Technical→missing entities, fields, relationships; Operational→missing environment/resource/ownership concepts.
   - **Interaction & Flow**: Product→missing UX steps, error states; Technical→missing workflow/validation steps; Operational→missing operator/promotion/runbook flow.
   - **Non-Functional**: Missing performance, reliability, scale, observability targets.
   - **Integration**: Unclear external dependencies, interfaces, contracts, environment deps.
   - **Edge Cases**: Rate limits, partial failures, rollback, concurrency, degraded modes, recovery.
   - **Terminology**: Domain-specific terms used without definition. If 2+ undefined domain terms detected and no Glossary section exists, flag as a finding.
4. Generate 3–8 questions prioritized by `Impact × Uncertainty`.
   - Focus on material impact (architecture, data model, complexity).
   - Skip trivial copy-editing.
   - For technical/operational specs: prioritize capability boundaries, validation gaps, integration uncertainty.
5. Return a **single JSON block**:

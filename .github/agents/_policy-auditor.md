## Task
Audit artifacts against non-negotiable project instructions.
## Inputs
Target artifact path and `project-instructions.md`.
## Execution Rules
Read `.github/skills/compact-communication/SKILL.md` first. Evaluate each principle with explicit evidence and deterministic verdicts. Keep notes terse unless ambiguity or risk requires fuller prose.
## Output Format
Return a compact PASS/FAIL report with principle-level findings.

<input>
You will receive:
- `ArtifactPath`: The path to the artifact to check (e.g., `feature/spec.md` or `feature/plan.md`).
- (Implicit) You access `project-instructions.md` for the rules.
</input>

<workflow>

1. Read `project-instructions.md`; extract Principles as checkable rules. Read `ArtifactPath`.
2. For each Principle → find evidence in artifact → verdict: PASS, VIOLATION, or N/A → brief commentary.
3. Return report:

```markdown
### Instructions Check Report
**Target**: [Filename]
**Status**: [PASS | FAIL]

| Principle | Verdict | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| [Principle Name] | PASS/FAIL | [Evidence/Reasoning] |

**Violations**:
(List critical violations that block progress, if any)
```

- If PASS and there are no violations, keep notes minimal.
- If FAIL → calling agent must stop or request user justification.

</workflow>

/// Steps:

///    equals `section`.
/// 2. **Remove** those cells from the ship's [`FitLayout`] — the coarse,
///    cell-ready removal (INV-D08: the ONLY place connectivity runs; event-driven,
///    never per-frame). Record whether the core cell sat in the destroyed section.
/// 3. Compute the new [`core_cell`]. If there are no cells left **or** the core was
///    in the destroyed section, the **whole ship is destroyed** (INV-D15): flag it
///    (set [`HullStructure::current`] to `0` and attach a
///    [`Wreck`]`{ origin: DestroyedShip, .. }` marker) and return early — the
///    persistent-wreck spawn + salvage are Phase 6 (T032).
/// 4. Else run [`connected_region`] and, for **each** disconnected region (a maximal
///    4-connected component of the remaining cells NOT attached to the core), call
///    [`sever_chunk`]. Regions are iterated in a deterministic order (sorted by each
///    region's smallest-cell representative — [`disconnected_regions`]).
///
/// Runs once per destruction event (INV-D08). Server-authoritative (INV-D16). Total:
/// a missing fit / hull / layout is a no-op (never a panic).
